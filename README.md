# pythonsnippets

This is a repository for my "daily coding" files.  I've decided to do a little pythn every day to get better!

Most files are taken from here:

[Learning Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html) and 

[The Python CHallenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).
